* use only one header file if possible
* extract out lexer code
* replace GenerateCode by some sort of verbosity level: 
  - 0 : completely silent (identical as !GenerateCode), only used to check 
        that a file CAN be parsed
  - 1 : normal parse
  - 2 : verbose, lloc for all tokens, incl comments
